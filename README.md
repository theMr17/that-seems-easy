> *"Any bugs, unexpected behaviors, or sudden spikes you encounter are definitely features."*  

A deceptively simple, relaxing platformer centered around getting from point A to point B.  
What could possibly go wrong?  

Built with **Unity** for [IndieCritical Summer Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/indiecritical-summer-jam-2025-cash-prizes-and-coverage).

## Features
- Charming **pixel art** with questionable intentions  
- Straightforward controls (until they’re not)  
- **Illusionary platforms** and gravity-defying surprises  
- A developer who is *definitely* not on your side  
- Designed with **love (and a little malice)**  

## Gameplay
- **Jump** to clear obstacles. Try not to miss.  
- Avoid falling into pits. The floor is *usually* safer.  
- Some platforms may lie to you. Or not. Figure it out.  
- Reach the goal at the end of each level.  
- If you’re stuck… get better.  
- The real solution? The friends we made along the way. (*Just kidding. There are no friends here.*)
